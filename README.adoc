:toc: macro

Here you find links to several examples of the https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html[microservice architectural style].

toc::[right, preamble]

== Examples

==== Sock Shop
A (quite full-fledged) demo application, including nice UI plus monitoring. Implemented and maintained
by Weaveworks.

Their application is https://microservices-demo.github.io/[online]
and they have extensively documented their
https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/blob/master/internal-docs/design.md[architecture]

==== http://microservices-book.com/[Eberhard Wolff]
Eberhard has implemented several examples. Designed around a
fictional eCommerce enterprise, they consist of
three microservices: One to process orders, another to handle
customer data and a third to handle items in a catalogue.

You find versions for different technologies:

==== https://www.manning.com/books/the-tao-of-microservices[Richard Rodger]
Richard, author of https://www.manning.com/books/the-tao-of-microservices[The Tao of Microservices]
has implemented a search engine
for Node.js modules with a microservice architecture. He describes this example in his
book, but a basic documentation is provided with the (open source) implementation.
Btw: The system is available online at http://nodezoo.com/[nodezoo.com].

From his documentation:
[quote, Richard Rodger (Nodezoo.com): From his documentation]
Nodezoo is a search engine for Node.js modules. The nodezoo search engine is an example of a real-world service built using Node.js microservices. Each microservice is published in its own github repository along with all of the necessary config to run the system locally or live . The codebase is intended to be used as an example,
and as a starting point for your own projects.

* https://github.com/nodezoo[Nodezoo at Github], contains all the examples.
* https://github.com/nodezoo/nodezoo-workshop[Nodezoo Workshop], the entry-point into the actual code.

The last commits in these repositories are somewhat dated - I'm not sure if they are actively maintained.

Centered around the concept of _messages_ that are transmitted between services.

You're completely free to use these links - but _as-is_, there's no (as in zero) guarantuee
that the examples will be working or any linked information is correct. I did my best
to check and verify... but that might not be good enough for you...

So - you're left on your own.
